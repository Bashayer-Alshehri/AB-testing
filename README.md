# Analyze-A-B-test-result
A/B test

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

## Introduction:
> A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

> For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Statistics used:
- Probability
- A/B Test
- Regression


## Conclusion:
- None of the variables have significant p-values. Therefore, we will fail to reject the null and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that there is an interaction between country and page received that will predict whether a user converts or not.
